      <p class="lead my-3">
        After studying at The London College of Fashion in the early
        1980s I worked in the fashion and retail industry for over 30
        years before deciding to pursue my love of hats by creating
        bespoke pieces in 2013.<br />

        Drawing inspiration from my collection of vintage millinery
        and a long held love of the classic films of the 1930s and
        1940s and the glamorous clothes the stars wore in them, I
        fashion individual styles using unique vintage trimmings
        and fabrics so that each piece has a completely individual
        look.<br />

        I work closely with clients to create something really special
        in colours to match specific fabrics or outfits and taking time
        to discuss what occasion they are buying for and how they
        want to look and feel.<br />

        I live in leafy South East London with my photographer
        husband and our cats Monty and Betty and miniature
        schnauzer Rita.<br />
